Novelty
In case “unusual” visual elements are being used/tested, the designer must ask herself/himself “why?”.

If this question can be answered with a valid argument, the “unusual” visual element may have its place. Bringing it up to the developers will help decide if the technical implications, in addition to the unusualness of the element, are worth the time and effort.

If a consensus can be reached between designers and developers, the element has its place.
